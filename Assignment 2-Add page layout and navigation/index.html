        Web Servers
    </h3>

    <p>
        <!--Explain what index means as it relates to websites and servers-->
        When a client goes to a webpage, <strong>index.html</strong> is the page the server will send back to show the client. 
        The index.html file is the name of the resource on the server. As a convention, most web servers are 
        configured so that the request for / is mapped to the file at the path /index.html. This file is 
        called the designated <strong>homepage</strong> on the web server. In almost all real-world web applications, the 
        file index.html in the root directory is called the home page of the web application, and the web 
        application is configured to return this file whenever a <strong>GET request</strong> receives the <strong>URL</strong>. Index.html 
        is the default name for a home page of a website hosted on an Apache web server.
    </p>
    <p>
        <!--Explain what you see in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector tools. What is different about the file's 
        details on the web server versus the local computer?-->
        The web server version takes more than twice the amount of time to access than the local computer 
        version. The web server version uses the same index.html as the local computer, but the web server  
        version runs a <strong>JavaScript</strong> called executor.js and uses favicon.ico for making a custom browser tab icon. 
        The browser tab and contents for both web server and local computer shows my name, Tony Chan, and same 
        contents. The <strong>HTTP request</strong> lines for the two versions are similar, except for the URL paths. Both have 
        the <strong>GET</strong> request method and the same successful <strong>request response</strong> of 200. The web server version has 
        an IP address for finding the target web server, but the local computer version does not. The <strong>request 
        header</strong> for the web server version shows the client can handle text/html, English and encoding types. 
        The local computer request header references Chrome, which can do the same things. The request method 
        is GET, which means the request header body will be empty. No document is being requested. The <strong>HTTP 
        response</strong> are different for the two versions. In this example, no separate server is invoked. 
        The request is just for a static index.html file, which is sent back to the client. The local computer 
        version has minimal <strong>response header</strong> content. The web server version has more response header content 
        and the content type is specified as test/html. The web server version has to access a server far away 
        and more information is needed. A <strong>TCP/IP</strong> connection needs to be opened to the web server. The response 
        header has connection set to keep alive and uses an Apache server program. The <strong>response header body</strong>
        is the index.html file at the web server address, which is sent back to the client. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <!--Explain why the favicon.ico file has a status 200, but the main.css and main.js files do not.-->
        The <strong>response status</strong> for favicon.ico is 200, which means the HTTP request was successfully processed 
        by the server. The files <strong>main.css</strong> and <strong>main.js</strong> do not have a response status code and are showing 
        errors. The browser inspection tool indicates the main.css and main.js files do not exist and are 
        generating an error for each. The line of code with command link is looking for these two files. 
        After I create these two files in the same directory as index.html, the errors are eliminated and 
        the response status code is 200 for each file. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <!--Explain the parts of the URL to your web file. What are the scheme, subdomain, host domain, and 
        resources?-->
        The <strong>URL</strong> to my web file is a unique identifier. The scheme in my web file is HTTPS. A URL starts with 
        a <strong>scheme</strong> which identifies the protocol the web client must use to request the resource. A <strong>subdomain</strong> 
        is a subsection of that <strong>domain/server</strong>. Its name is appended to the front of the <strong>domain name</strong>. In my 
        web file, the subdomains are “web” and “engr.” The domain name is mapped to the IP address for that 
        server machine. In my web file, the domain name is oregonstate.edu. The resource in my web file URL 
        is index.html and the <strong>resource path</strong> is ~chanto/a1-chanto/.

        Frontend Design
    </h3>

    <p>
        <!--The concept of frontend design-->
        Good <strong>frontend design</strong> is making the web page suitable to the users' experience and purpose
        of the web page. It includes adapting the viewing environment to the different formats users 
        may use like a mobile phone to big screen display. The graphical user interface needs to be 
        simple to use and intuitive. The organization of the web page should be similar to the front 
        page of a newspaper. The most relevant topics should be positioned to the top right, in order 
        to catch the users' eye first. Usability is about how easy it is for a customer to do one thing 
        such as making a purchase or searching for a topic of interest.

        <!--The purpose of page layout tags-->
        <strong>Page layout tags</strong> are <strong>block-level elements</strong> such as paragraph, headers, lists, 
        navigation, tables and many more. There are two categories called block level elements or <strong>inline level 
        elements</strong> that contribute to the flow control in HTML. A Block-level element occupies the entire 
        horizontal space, and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a “block”. 
        On the other hand, inline elements can start anywhere in a line. Browsers typically display the block-level 
        element with a newline both before and after the element. A block-level element always starts on a new line 
        and takes up the full width available. Block-level elements may appear only within a body element. 



    </p>

    <p>
        <!--How anchors link to content and from page to page? Clarification: What is the conceptual difference 
        between text anchors and navigation?-->
        We create links from one section or page to another using the <strong>anchor element</strong>. The content between the opening and closing anchor element tags should describe the link when someone clicks to navigate to it. The anchor element's <strong>HREF</strong> attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations on the same page, or anything else a URL can address. Content within each anchor element should indicate the link's destination. If the HREF attribute is present, pressing the enter key while focused on the anchor element will activate it. It is possible to use the anchor element's HREF attribute to link to a specific location within a document, rather than just the top of the document. <strong>Text anchor</strong> is an attribute to elements such as TEXT, TREF, TSPAN and more. It is used to align (start-, middle- or end-alignment) a string of pre-formatted text or auto-wrapped text and is applied to each individual text chunk within a given <text> element. The <strong>navigation</strong> HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes. The navigation element is intended only for a major block of navigation links. A document may have several navigation elements, for example, one for site navigation and one for inside the same page navigation.
