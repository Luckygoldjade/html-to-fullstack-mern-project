        <!--Explain what index means as it relates to websites and servers-->
        When a client goes to a webpage, index.html is the page the server will send back to show the client. 
        The index.html file is the name of the resource on the server. As a convention, most web servers are 
        configured so that the request for / is mapped to the file at the path /index.html. This file is 
        called the designated homepage on the web server. In almost all real-world web applications, the 
        file index.html in the root directory is called the home page of the web application, and the web 
        application is configured to return this file whenever a GET request receives the URL. Index.html 
        is the default name for a home page of a website hosted on an Apache web server.

        <!--Explain what you see in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector tools. What is different about the file's 
        details on the web server versus the local computer?-->
        The web server version takes more than twice the amount of time to access than the local computer 
        version. The web server version uses the same index.html as the local computer, but the web server  
        version runs a JavaScript called executor.js and uses favicon.ico for making a custom browser tab icon. 
        The browser tab and contents for both web server and local computer shows my name, Tony Chan, and same 
        contents. The HTTP request lines for the two versions are similar, except for the URL paths. Both have 
        the GET request method and the same successful request response of 200. The web server version has 
        an IP address for finding the target web server, but the local computer version does not. The request 
        header for the web server version shows the client can handle text/html, English and encoding types. 
        The local computer request header references Chrome, which can do the same things. The request method 
        is GET, which means the request header body will be empty. No document is being requested. The HTTP 
        response are different for the two versions. In this example, no separate server is invoked. 
        The request is just for a static index.html file, which is sent back to the client. The local computer 
        version has minimal response header content. The web server version has more response header content 
        and the content type is specified as test/html. The web server version has to access a server far away 
        and more information is needed. A TCP/IP connection needs to be opened to the web server. The response 
        header has connection set to keep alive and uses an Apache server program. The response header body 
        is the index.html file at the web server address, which is sent back to the client.

        <!--Explain why the favicon.ico file has a status 200, but the main.css and main.js files do not.-->
        The response status for favicon.ico is 200, which means the HTTP request was successfully processed 
        by the server. The files main.css and main.js do not have a response status code and are showing 
        errors. The browser inspection tool indicates the main.css and main.js files do not exist and are 
        generating an error for each. The line of code with command link is looking for these two files. 
        After I create these two files in the same directory as index.html, the errors are eliminated and 
        the response status code is 200 for each file.

        <!--Explain the parts of the URL to your web file. What are the scheme, subdomain, host domain, and 
        resources?-->
        The URL to my web file is a unique identifier. The scheme in my web file is HTTPS. A URL starts with 
        a scheme which identifies the protocol the web client must use to request the resource. A subdomain 
        is a subsection of that domain/server. Its name is appended to the front of the domain name. In my 
        web file, the subdomains are “web” and “engr.” The domain name is mapped to the IP address for that 
        server machine. In my web file, the domain name is oregonstate.edu. The resource in my web file URL 
        is index.html and the resource path is ~chanto/a1-chanto/.
