    <h3>
        Web Servers
    </h3>

    <p>
        <!--Explain what index means as it relates to websites and servers-->
        When a client goes to a webpage, <strong>index.html</strong> is the page the server will send back to show the client. 
        The index.html file is the name of the resource on the server. As a convention, most web servers are 
        configured so that the request for / is mapped to the file at the path /index.html. This file is 
        called the designated <strong>homepage</strong> on the web server. In almost all real-world web applications, the 
        file index.html in the root directory is called the home page of the web application, and the web 
        application is configured to return this file whenever a <strong>GET request</strong> receives the <strong>URL</strong>. Index.html 
        is the default name for a home page of a website hosted on an Apache web server.
    </p>
    <p>
        <!--Explain what you see in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector tools. What is different about the file's 
        details on the web server versus the local computer?-->
        The web server version takes more than twice the amount of time to access than the local computer 
        version. The web server version uses the same index.html as the local computer, but the web server  
        version runs a <strong>JavaScript</strong> called executor.js and uses favicon.ico for making a custom browser tab icon. 
        The browser tab and contents for both web server and local computer shows my name, Tony Chan, and same 
        contents. The <strong>HTTP request</strong> lines for the two versions are similar, except for the URL paths. Both have 
        the <strong>GET</strong> request method and the same successful <strong>request response</strong> of 200. The web server version has 
        an IP address for finding the target web server, but the local computer version does not. The <strong>request 
        header</strong> for the web server version shows the client can handle text/html, English and encoding types. 
        The local computer request header references Chrome, which can do the same things. The request method 
        is GET, which means the request header body will be empty. No document is being requested. The <strong>HTTP 
        response</strong> are different for the two versions. In this example, no separate server is invoked. 
        The request is just for a static index.html file, which is sent back to the client. The local computer 
        version has minimal <strong>response header</strong> content. The web server version has more response header content 
        and the content type is specified as test/html. The web server version has to access a server far away 
        and more information is needed. A <strong>TCP/IP</strong> connection needs to be opened to the web server. The response 
        header has connection set to keep alive and uses an Apache server program. The <strong>response header body</strong>
        is the index.html file at the web server address, which is sent back to the client. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <!--Explain why the favicon.ico file has a status 200, but the main.css and main.js files do not.-->
        The <strong>response status</strong> for favicon.ico is 200, which means the HTTP request was successfully processed 
        by the server. The files <strong>main.css</strong> and <strong>main.js</strong> do not have a response status code and are showing 
        errors. The browser inspection tool indicates the main.css and main.js files do not exist and are 
        generating an error for each. The line of code with command link is looking for these two files. 
        After I create these two files in the same directory as index.html, the errors are eliminated and 
        the response status code is 200 for each file. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <!--Explain the parts of the URL to your web file. What are the scheme, subdomain, host domain, and 
        resources?-->
        The <strong>URL</strong> to my web file is a unique identifier. The scheme in my web file is HTTPS. A URL starts with 
        a <strong>scheme</strong> which identifies the protocol the web client must use to request the resource. A <strong>subdomain</strong> 
        is a subsection of that <strong>domain/server</strong>. Its name is appended to the front of the <strong>domain name</strong>. In my 
        web file, the subdomains are “web” and “engr.” The domain name is mapped to the IP address for that 
        server machine. In my web file, the domain name is oregonstate.edu. The resource in my web file URL 
        is index.html and the <strong>resource path</strong> is ~chanto/a1-chanto/.

        Frontend Design
    </h3>

    <p>
        <!--The concept of frontend design-->
        <strong>Frontend design</strong> is about creating an interface that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional. This means considering the user's experience and the purpose of the web page. One important consideration is adapting the viewing environment to different formats, from mobile phones to large screen displays, to ensure that the web page is accessible and usable on any device.

        The <strong>graphical user interface (GUI)</strong> is a key component of frontend design. It should be simple to use and intuitive, with clear navigation and prominent calls to action. The organization of the web page should be logical and easy to follow, with the most significant information positioned prominently to catch the user's attention. While the top right corner is often a good position for key information, this can vary depending on the purpose and content of the web page.

        Color can be used to evoke emotions and create contrast, while typography and fonts can convey hierarchy and readability. Media such as images and videos can also enhance the user experience, but should be used sparingly to avoid overwhelming the user.

        Usability is a critical component of frontend design. It's about making it easy for users to accomplish specific tasks, such as making a purchase or searching for a topic of interest. This means designing with the user in mind and considering factors such as load times, clear messaging, and accessibility for users with disabilities.

        Overall, frontend design is a complex and multifaceted discipline that requires careful consideration of a wide range of factors. By focusing on user experience, GUI design, organization, and usability, designers can create effective and engaging frontend designs.

        <!--The purpose of page layout tags-->
        <strong>Page layout tags</strong> are <strong>block-level elements</strong> such as paragraph, headers, lists, 
        navigation, tables and many more. There are two categories called block level elements or <strong>inline level 
        elements</strong> that contribute to the flow control in HTML. A Block-level element occupies the entire 
        horizontal space, and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a “block”. 
        On the other hand, inline elements can start anywhere in a line. Browsers typically display the block-level 
        element with a newline both before and after the element. A block-level element always starts on a new line 
        and takes up the full width available. Block-level elements may appear only within a body element. 

    </p>

    <p>
        <!--How anchors link to content and from page to page? Clarification: What is the conceptual difference 
        between text anchors and navigation?-->
        We create links from one section or page to another using the <strong>anchor element</strong>. The content between the opening and closing anchor element tags should describe the link when someone clicks to navigate to it. The anchor element's <strong>HREF</strong> attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations on the same page, or anything else a URL can address. Content within each anchor element should indicate the link's destination. If the HREF attribute is present, pressing the enter key while focused on the anchor element will activate it. It is possible to use the anchor element's HREF attribute to link to a specific location within a document, rather than just the top of the document. <strong>Text anchor</strong> is an attribute to elements such as TEXT, TREF, TSPAN and more. It is used to align (start-, middle- or end-alignment) a string of pre-formatted text or auto-wrapped text and is applied to each individual text chunk within a given <text> element. The <strong>navigation</strong> HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes. The navigation element is intended only for a major block of navigation links. A document may have several navigation elements, for example, one for site navigation and one for inside the same page navigation.

    <h3>Optimizing Images</h3>
    
    <p>
        <!--What are the 6 major specifications of images for the web? And why?-->
        <!--Which file formats are most appropriate for photos and for line art? And why?-->
        In order to improve the image usability of HTML and loading of webpage images, there are six image specifications for the web. 
        <ul>
            <li>Use descriptive and short file names that contain who, what, when and where. Search engines will scan file names for categorization for others looking for this topic. </li>
            <li>Use compression applications to reduce file sizes to as small as possible in order to reduce load times, but do not sacrifice image quality too much. </li>
            <li>Crop the images to the dimensions that will fit your webpage space. Frame the image on one main point, which will help the viewer know what the image is about and not get distracted by other objects. For displaying programming code, just show a small function or a section of code that is readable.</li>
                
            <li>The correct file format for pictures is <strong>JPEG</strong>. It is a good choice for lossy compression of still images and is currently the most popular. JPEG files are only used for photographic images. They compress down to small file sizes and remain rectangular. <strong>Graphics Interchange Format, GIF,</strong> and 8-bit <strong>PNG</strong> are correct file formats for logos, icons, and line art. GIF is a good choice for simple images and animations. GIF files can have 8-bit transparency and/or animation and are typically used for line-art graphics. Their edges anti-alias to one background matte color. Portable Network Graphics, PNG, is preferred over JPEG for more precise reproduction of source images, or when transparency is needed. </li>
            
            <li>Image usability will provide multiple image sizes for a range of monitor sizes is becoming a standard. Responsive images are images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features. This helps to improve performance across different devices. An improvement would be to display a cropped version of the image which displays the important details of the image when the site is viewed on a narrow screen. A second cropped image could be displayed on a medium width screen device, like a tablet. The general problem whereby you want to serve different cropped images in that way, for various layouts, is commonly known as the art direction problem. In addition, there is no need to embed such large images on the page if it is being viewed on a mobile screen. Doing so can waste bandwidth; in particular, mobile users don't want to waste bandwidth by downloading a large image intended for desktop users, when a small image would do for their device. Ideally, multiple resolutions would be made available to the user's web browser. The browser could then determine the optimal resolution to load based on the screen size of the user's device. </li>
            
            <li>Lastly, for image usability, there is a color mode for HTML with 256 predefined HTML colors such as red, blue, pink and more. Other color modes are <strong>hex</strong> (hexadecimal) codes, <strong>RGB</strong> (red, green, blue), <strong>RGBA</strong> (red, green, blue, alpha), and <strong>HSL</strong> (hue, saturation, lightness). Select which color mode by file format such as RGB for PNG, JPG, SVG, and WebP, and Indexed for GIF. </li>

        </ul>

    <h3>Cascading Stylesheets</h3>
    <p>
        <!--What are the main reasons to incorporate stylesheets in websites and apps?-->
        Before <strong>Cascading Style Sheets, CSS</strong>, HTML had a big problem. It was, HTML was never intended to contain tags for formatting a web page. Then in some later versions of HTML, fonts and color information were added to the language. Developers had the difficulty to consistently maintaining style formatting page by page. CSS changed all that. It removed the style formatting from the HTML page. CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout, and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files. With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file, which saves the developer from a lot of work adjusting page by page. It allows the developer to make the webpage to what he is envisioning it to be.

    </p>
    <p>
        <!--What are the 5 ways to incorporate styles? And why?-->
        A main external CSS file can be linked in the global head of an index.html. Other stylesheets for specific components can be linked after the global CSS file or, imported into that global stylesheet. There are five different ways to include styles after the global stylesheet. 
        <ul>
            <li>The first method, an externally linked CSS file. For this webpage, the global stylesheet example is &lt;link rel="stylesheet” type="text/css” media="screen” href="main.css”&gt; or use import, @import “component1.css”;</li>
            <li>The second method is embed or internal style within a &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; tag. An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.  An example is &lt;style&gt; h1 {color: blue;} p {color: red;} &lt;/style&gt; </li>
            <li>The third way is inline, which uses the style attribute of an HTML element. The element's attribute and value are used. An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element. An example is &lt;h1 style="color:blue;”&gt;A Blue Heading &lt;/h1&gt;</li>
            <li>A fourth method is in JavaScript template literals within a JavaScript function. </li>
            <li>Lastly, In regular JavaScript, by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM).</li>

        </ul>
