# Academic project completed in Spring 2023

## Project Title: HTML to Fullstack MERN Project
Start with HTML webpages and change stage by stage into a fullstack MERN website. It will be a 
client side rendering using React.

Log your stock option trades such as underlying stock, number of contracts, expiration date, start date and exit date, just like using a stock portfolio account from a stock brokerage. 

This repository contains my independent copy of a collaborative academic project completed as part of the 
Computer Science program.

## Key Features
Product Management:
Track options trade log details (underlying stock, number of contracts, expiration date, start date and exit date).

Modular Full-Stack Architecture
Organized by development stages with isolated node_modules and package.json files per stage.

React Frontend with Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
Interactive UI built with React using map() to render product options trade data dynamically as rows.

Node.js & Express Backend
REST API built using Express to handle HTTP requests and serve options trade data.

MongoDB Integration with Mongoose
Connected to a MongoDB cluster using a defined Mongoose schema to support full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Live Data Interaction
Options trade list dynamically fetched from MongoDB and rendered on the frontend — simulating real-world stock portfolio account.

Educational Emphasis
Designed for hands-on learning with clean separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and database.

## What You Learned
Developed a full-stack JavaScript application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

Gained hands-on experience with Mongoose to define schemas and perform CRUD operations on MongoDB data.

Learned how to structure REST APIs using Express to serve JSON data to the frontend.

Used React's map() function to render dynamic lists of products from backend data.

Understood how to separate concerns between frontend, backend, and database layers in a modular project.

Practiced environment-specific setup with isolated node_modules and package.json files per development stage.

Improved ability to debug and visualize data using tools like console.table() in Node.js.

Strengthened skills in using npm scripts for running, building, and testing applications.

Learned how to simulate a real-world data flow from MongoDB cluster to REST API to React component.
